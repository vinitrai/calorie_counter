a small project to get the calorie and nutrition values of a food item

# This is a basic project involving HTML,CSS and Javascript

A user enters a food item into the search bar and the portion size,where he gets back the food's nutritious value as a result.
The idea is to let the user know about the nutritions and glycemic index(GI) and let him/her decide whether the food is good to eat or not.

People those who are suffering with diabetes,heart diseases,blood pressure etc may take a decision based on the app's results.
A user may be able to search,filter(based on ratings,results etc).
We want to have different categories(breakfast,lunch,dinner) as well,including the best foods across different locations(countriess),best(healthwise).

I request you all to come up with a mored detailed suggestions on what more to include in this project and how can we make this one a very useful product.

For ideas and suggestions,plz explore a few APIs and similar sites if available.
